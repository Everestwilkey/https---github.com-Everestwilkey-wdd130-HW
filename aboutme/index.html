    <h2> Everest Wilkey </h2>
    <h2> My nick name is Eman </h2>
    <h3> Hobbies inclued Rc cars, sking, fishing and gamming</h3>
    <p> Helllo my name is Everest I love the out doors. Fun fact my brother is 
        in this class and we love video games. I also love to fish build and break 
        RC cars. I'm married to my wonderful wife Jasmine we got married in December of 2021! </p>
    <p>My current job I have three right now. I'm a social media manager for the Career Center, 
       I'm also a social media manager for a small RV park, then I'm a TA for Amazon class.</p>
    <p>I recently made a big decision in changing my degree to software engineering. I was a marketing major but 
       I found that I didn't really like all the theoretical classes and I wanted to do something that I could 
       make almost sudo hands on. </p>
    <p>The advantages I see from learning about careers in web design are that first you 
        open more doors and more opportunities. You learn a lot about HTML and CSS being 
        able to build your own websites and hopefully you can use Java later down the road 
        in order to build the applications that could be hosted on websites.</p>
    <p>What I hope to get out of this course is a better knowledge of web development as well 
       as HTML and CSS and hopefully be able to intermingle that with Java later down the road.
       I hope to develop a website one day and an application that will be able to work with 
       Facebook and Instagram in order to help small businesses do marketing and advertising 
       and having the appliction do all the hard work.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life one of my favorite quotes is from Elder Jeffrey R Holland
       “However late you think you are, however many chances you think you have missed, however many mistakes you 
       feel you have made or talents you think you don’t have, or however far from home and family and God you feel 
       you have traveled, I testify that you have not traveled beyond the reach of divine love. It is not possible for 
       you to sink lower than the infinite light of Christ’s Atonement shines.”
       ―Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, "The Laborers in the Vineyard"
       My favorite scripture is Helaman 5:12
