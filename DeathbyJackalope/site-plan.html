        [We've all been on websites especially that just really or just not great. We struggle to put the pieces together in order to figure out where to check out it's not very intuitive we want people to know where they're at in the process get them to the products they want and not waste their time no pop up ads no bad promotions we all go on websites and they all try to get us sign up on their e-mail list and it's always super frustrating because I just want to see what they have I really don't want to sign up for them promotional information. And if there's going to be deals available they need to be clear they need to be there in apparent and already applied when check out no more promo codes I think it's so annoying when websites hide their promo codes saying you can have 30% off and then the customer gets really frustrated or I get frustrated and can't get there and find the promo code and when you do it's over. So no more crap and just get straight to the point and help people see the stuff they want and then add a suggestion a little bit later down the road about some things because an upsell is always good but not upselling them every step of the way.]

      <p>
        [My website will be targeted toward younger adults and outdoors folks who like extreme action sports or just sports in general. They need something that's durable and will last them a long time such as nice durable T-shirts that can endure harsh weather and tough conditions. But not sacrificing on the way it feels the quality will be supreme and that this will be the number one standard that everything will be compared to. If people are going to use these in action sports they need to be able to be washable reusable and durable for the long duration. People will come to this website because of the product itself or products if it is not what I claim it to be then people will walk away. People might have questions about how the size and fit will work and I'm going to make sure that people will have the ability to see what is going on but more importantly when talking about durability and quality making sure they know what kind of fabrics are being used if they're soft smooth or stretchy or if they're rigid or durable and provide quality testing and show real life case studies where people take this stuff out and abuse it.]
